 dryRun= false when we are doing test execution. dryRun=true when we are generation missing step definitions
When you run Runner, it will go to feature file, and start execution from top to bottom.
        If there is any step matching, Java will find that matching 'stepdefinition', and it will be executed.
        If there is no match then Cucumber will generate template for us in the console.

//dryRun=false when we are doing test execution by opening a browser
// dryRun=true when we are generation missing step definitions
//It is used in runner class to run the test case with or without browser.
// When we use with true browser will not be opened, and we generate just step definitions.
//Background is like before tag, we use it for pre-conditions and it is executed before each scenario
//feature file is not technical but step definitions is the technical part of the test.
/*
-->What is cucumber?
Cucumber is a testing framework. It is a BDD(Behaviour Driven Development) framework.
-->BDD means we describe the behavior(functionality) in the feature file first, then write the code
-->What is feature file?
It is used to write test cases in Gherkin language. It has keywords like given, when , then,…This is plane English.
-->What is Background?
It is used for repeated PRE CONDITIONS. This runs before each Scenario keyword.
-->What is Scenario:
It is used to create test cases in feature files. I can use more than 1 scenario keyword in a future file.
-->What is Feature:
This is used to create a feature file. Each feature file must begin with a Feature keyword. They cannot be more than 1 Feature keyword in a feature file
-->How do you run specific test cases in cucumber?
We use runner class to run the test cases. We can run specific test scenarios or feature files using tags.
-->What is dryRun in cucumber?
To generate missing/unimplemented step definitions, we use dryRun=true. When I want to run test cases, I do dryRun=false.
-->What is step definition in cucumber?
Technical codes goes to step definition classes. We write the java code in these classes.
-->How do you parametrize the feature files?How do you get the data from the feature file? How do you make the test cases more reusable in cucumber.What is your strategy?
String “” makes the data dynamic. We can use Scenario Outline, data tables as well
